# Dare to Compare
# We mentioned that hash lookup is faster with symbol keys than with string keys.
# Here, we'll prove it!
#
# The code in the editor uses some new syntax, so don't worry about understanding
# all of it just yet. It builds two alphabet hashes: one that pairs string letters
#  with their place in the alphabet ( "a" with 1, "b" with 2...) and one that uses
#   symbols (:a with 1, :b with 2...). We'll look up the letter "r" 100,000 times
#   to see which process runs faster!
#
# It's good to keep in mind that the numbers you'll see are only fractions of a
#  second apart, and we did the hash lookup 100,000 times each.
#  It's not much of a performance increase to use symbols in this case, but it's definitely there!
